# Front-end Web Development

This is a beginner level course but students are expected to have a general knowledge of computers such as opening and saving files. While this course is self paced, it is recommended that students spend a minimum of 12 hours weekly on the course. In the previous lesson, we discussed READMEs and Labs. Now we'll give you more specifics on what you can expect from the lessons. 

### Lecture Videos & Readings

All videos the instructor demonstrates using a Macintosh computer although commands should be the same or similiar on PC (Windows). These videos are best viewed by clicking the gear icon in the bottom right corner of each video and setting the resolution to 720p HD or higher if available and then clicking the Full Screen icon in the right corner. Some videos contain playlists indicated by a menu icon (displayed as 3 lines) at the top left of the video. You can access the individual videos in a playlist by clicking this icon and selecting from the displayed videos listed by topic.  Most video lectures are also accompanied by readings that will reinforce the content of the lecture. Supplementary resources are also provided at the bottom of each lesson. You can skip over the resources if you are pressed for time, or delve deeply into them if you have an abundance of time as they will complement the lessons and provide more information on the topics of a lesson.

### Code Along Exercises

Code Alongs are lecture videos where you are asked to code along with the instructor. You will be asked to fork and clone code (which we will teach you how to do) and then type along with the instructor in the code provided as you are watching the video. This acts as a guide to show you how to put the topics you learned in the prior lessons to practice in a real website. This will reinforce previously covered topics as well as give deeper context of how these topics fit together into the larger picture of site development. You can also use these videos as stepping stones to mirror when you are building your own personal site project if you are unable to freely build your site and wish to have more structured instructions during that process.

### Quizzes

At critical milestones short quizzes are provided to test your knowledge of the current unit. Upon selecting an answer the actual answer will be displayed. If you do not get all the questions right, you can review the previous lessons from that unit. Quizzes are just for checking your own knowledge and confidence building and will not be counted against you.

### Labs

Most learning units contain multiple labs. For each challenge you will be asked to open the lab in the local IDE that we've set you up with. Then you will follow along with the instructions in the README.md file. After completing your lab you will submit it and be able to move on to the next lesson. 

### Personal Site Project

Each student will build a personal website project for the course. At particular milestones students will be instructed to add particular features to their personal website project. The purpose of this project is to put into practice the things you have learned in the current completed unit. The site will progress with each unit giving you an understanding of how each concept fits together into a larger picture of how to build responsive websites. Each personal project is unique in content and it is up to you to decide what the subject matter of your site will be. Choose something that is simple enough to be executed in under a month spending a minimum of 3 or 4 hours per week working on it. Sites must be static content that is the same for all users. Do not plan on having a database or a site that requires a backend such as an ecommerce site or web app like Facebook. Keep it simple. Examples would be something like a portfolio site, family website, wedding site, fan site for a pet, friend, band, or a marketing site for a small business or non-profit. We will talk more about this project in a future lesson.
